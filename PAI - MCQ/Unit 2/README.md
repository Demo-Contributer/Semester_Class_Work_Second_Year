1. **Q:** In a time-sensitive application, you require efficient data access. How does the use of registers in the 8086 programming model improve performance compared to memory operations?

   a) Registers have faster access times than memory. ✅  
   b) Registers can store more data than memory.  
   c) Registers operate independently of the CPU.  
   d) Registers are used only for control operations.

3. **Q:** A subroutine accesses local variables stored on the stack. Which register is commonly used to point to the base of the stack frame?

   a) AX  
   b) DX  
   c) BP ✅  
   d) SI

4. **Q:** An instruction requires accessing the next byte of data in a string. Which index register would be incremented in this scenario?

   a) SI ✅  
   b) DI  
   c) SP  
   d) BP

5. **Q:** A stack-based operation requires accessing local variables. Which register is typically used to manage the stack frame in the 8086 programming model?

   a) BX  
   b) SP  
   c) BP ✅  
   d) IP

6. **Q:** During system initialization, the processor needs to access the BIOS. Which segment register holds the address for accessing this low-level system code?

   a) CS (Code Segment) ✅  
   b) DS (Data Segment)  
   c) SS (Stack Segment)  
   d) ES (Extra Segment)
