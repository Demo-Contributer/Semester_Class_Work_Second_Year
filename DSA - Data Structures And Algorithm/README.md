# How do I provide inputs to the program?
- Many of you are facing issues with the termination of the program. 
- I have now posted screenshots of the input below; please refer to them for better clarity.

    <h3>Binary Tree</h3> 
    <p>To input data in a binary tree, enter the data you want (e.g., 1) and press Enter. The program will then ask whether you want to insert the data on the left or right. You can continue entering data accordingly. To terminate, simply type -1 as shown below.<p/>

    <h3>Binary Search Tree</h3>
    <p>To input data in a binary search tree, you need to provide all the data at once, like 1 2 5 etc. To terminate the input, type -1 at the end. <p/>

    <h3>Threaded Binary Tree</h3>
    <p>To input data in a threaded binary tree, you need to provide all the data at once, like 1 4 5 etc. To terminate the input, type -1 at the end. <p/>

    <h3>Graphs</h3>
    <p>To input data in a graph, enter the number of vertices you want. Then, press 1 if you want to connect the vertices, or 0 if you do not. <p/>
